# docker-playground-mysql

This repository demonstrates the creation of a MySQL Docker container by a GitHub Action (started manually). This includes:

* Database initialisation (creating a user, a database, populating the latter)
* Build and upload the resulting image to ghcr.io
* Deploy Kubernetes manifest to Kubernetes cluster
